# ML-Project
ML-Project is a project in which I scraped data from yahoo finance and loaded the data into a local MySQL server on my machine. Connection between my python program and the database is done using SQLalchemy.

Current Tech Stack:
- Python, Selenium, Pandas for data extraction and manipulation
- MySQL and MySQL workbench serves as the database and database query tool
- SQLalchemy connects the python program to the local MySQL database

## Future Plans:
Scrape more meaningful data and load the data into the database using the methods I have already built. Then using the data to train machine learning models using Tensforflow and do meaningful data analysis.
